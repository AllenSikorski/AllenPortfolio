intro: >-
  Hi! I'm **Allen Sikorski**, a **Systems Administrator and Network Engineer** 🧠 based in **Albuquerque, USA** 🇺🇸. I design and deploy secure, automated IT systems that bridge on-prem and cloud infrastructure. Over the past 7+ years, I’ve architected solutions spanning **VMware ESXi clusters**, **UniFi networks**, and **Node-RED automation frameworks**, connecting people, systems, and devices through resilient design.

study: >-
  I’ve completed **university-level coursework toward a B.S. in Computer and Electrical Engineering**, focusing on **network architecture**, **cybersecurity**, and **systems design**. My technical foundation blends hardware and software disciplines, supported by professional experience in **cloud architecture**, **infrastructure automation**, and **endpoint security**. I routinely build with tools like **Docker**, **PowerShell**, **Python**, and **Grafana** to streamline IT operations and visualize real-time data across hybrid environments.

passion_text: >-
  I’m passionate about **automation and system security**: building infrastructure that runs itself and protects itself. From **Node-RED** workflows that trigger alerts through **Twilio** and **MQTT**, to **multi-site VPN and firewall deployments** using **PfSense** and **AWS**, I enjoy translating complex needs into practical, self-healing systems. My focus is always on reliability, clarity, and control.

mix: >-
  My background spans **hardware, networking, and software integration**, combining technical precision with creative problem-solving. I’ve designed hybrid network topologies across multiple companies, integrated surveillance and IoT systems, and implemented full-stack monitoring dashboards. My approach is straightforward: automate what’s repetitive, secure what’s critical, and keep everything transparent and maintainable.

personal: >-
  Outside of work, I’m usually experimenting with **smart home automations**, building **Node-RED security flows**, or fine-tuning **Home Assistant** setups. I’m passionate about technology, but also about **music**, **photography**, and spending time with my daughter. For me, tech isn’t just a career: it’s a craft I practice every day ⚡.
